Computer programming (often shortened to programming or
coding) is the process of writing, testing, debugging /
troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer
programs. This source code is written in a programming language.
The code may be a modification of an existing source or
something completely new. The purpose of programming is to
create a program that exhibits a certain desired behavior
(customization). The process of writing source code often
requires expertise in many different subjects, including
knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and
formal logic.
